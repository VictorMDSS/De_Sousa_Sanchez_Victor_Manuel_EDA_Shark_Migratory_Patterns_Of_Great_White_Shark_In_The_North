# 🌊 Joint Project with **Ocearch**: **Migration Patterns of White Sharks** in the Westernn North Atlantic 🦈

## Introduction

Hello, my name is **Victor Manuel De Sousa Sanchez**, and I am excited to share my collaborative project with **Ocearch** on the **Migration Patterns of White Sharks** in the **Westernn North Atlantic**.

This research project has been made possible through the invaluable tracking data provided by **Ocearch**, who have been closely monitoring the movements of White Sharks.

## 📍 **Project Overview**

This project aims to dive into the fascinating world of shark migration. By analyzing Ocearch’s extensive tracking data, we aim to uncover key insights into the movement behaviors of these incredible creatures. Specifically, we seek to answer:

- **How do White Sharks move over time?**
- **Is there a seasonal pattern to their migrations?**
- **Do sharks follow specific routes influenced by human activity or other factors?**

## 📊 **Objective**

The primary goal of this research is to understand the underlying factors that influence shark migration patterns. By identifying correlations with human routes, times of day, and seasonal variations, this project aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts of shark conservation and management.

Through data analysis, visualizations, and insights, we hope to bring new knowledge that can help protect these majestic animals and promote sustainable ocean practices.

## 🌍 **Why This Matters**

With shark populations declining in certain areas, understanding their migration is more important than ever. Our findings can aid in creating effective conservation strategies and ensure the survival of these apex predators in our oceans.

## ⚙️ **Tools & Methodology**

- **Data Source**: Ocearch's real-time tracking data
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Data Visualization
- **Key Insights**: Correlation analysis, seasonal migration patterns.
